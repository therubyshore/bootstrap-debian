# These variables will take effect in bash (see ~/.bashrc for how it's done),
# and in any systemd unit with EnvironmentFile=/home/admin/environment.conf
#
# To set an environment variable here:
# VARIABLE_NAME=value
# or:
# VARIABLE_NAME="value"
#
# This is useful when used on servers that start, stop and manage the web app using one or more systemd services and timers.
#
# If this server is running an application that runs entirely within Docker, and uses docker-compose,
# server-specific environment variables can be set for individual containers in the docker-compose.override.yaml file instead,
# and adding variables to this file is unnecessary.
